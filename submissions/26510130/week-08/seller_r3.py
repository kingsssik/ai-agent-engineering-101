"""Week 08 -- the Round 3 shop: sells units from stock, behind A2A v1.0.

    python seller_r3.py --port 9301          # the kit starts it; MARKET_DIR is .market/

What each part decides:

  code      which unit answers the buyer's request (the SKU it named, else the
            fitting unit that expires first, never one already promised or
            sold), and the floor / opening ask / warranty (pricing.py, from the
            unit's cost and age and from market_memory).
  harness   every move between the opening ask and the floor: counter, accept,
            or end. Its answer is clamped: no accept below the floor, no counter
            below the floor or above the last ask.
  receipt   signed over {shop, item, price, task}; `unit`, `claim` (the true
            grade) and `warranty_hours` ride along unsigned for the kit's ACP
            checkout, which takes them from what this seller sent.

The shop never lies about a unit. The market's certificate proves the grade and
the shelf life anyway, the ledger shows afterwards whether a claim was honest,
and buyers that check (this course's own buyer does) refuse a unit that fails
their policy -- after the negotiation, which wastes both sides' time.
